## 11/2/2025 - I just made the pcb :)))  

Just finished designing my PCB. Adding a photo below added a lot of design elements and really how I learned how to use tools in EasyEDA. I did follow the guide, but it's a circular shape. The wiring was really confusing to do though. ![Screenshot 2025-11-02 at 2.07.06 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Nzg0NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--54017dce4d3174b26d7025b31b49bc7463f77dbc/Screenshot%202025-11-02%20at%202.07.06%E2%80%AFPM.png)
